**TourBuddy** is a full-stack JavaScript application designed to allow users to browse and book travel tours. It follows the MERN stack architecture, combining **React** for the frontend with **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend. The application provides a clean, responsive user interface and a RESTful API to handle tour data and booking functionality.

**Project Overview:**

TourBuddy allows users to:

* View a list of available tours.
* Access detailed information for each tour, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
* Book tours through a structured form with client-side validation.
* Receive booking confirmation after submitting the form.

**Frontend:**
The frontend is built with React and includes:

* Reusable components for consistent UI elements.
* Pages for tour listings, tour details, booking forms, and confirmations.
* Routing with React Router for smooth navigation.
* Responsive design using Bootstrap for compatibility across devices.
* Animations and image galleries to enhance the user experience.

**Backend:**
The backend uses Node.js and Express to provide:

* RESTful API endpoints to retrieve and serve tour data.
* Controllers to handle logic for fetching tours and processing bookings.
* Routes organized by feature for maintainability.
* A default configuration to run on port 8000, with flexibility to change.

**Folder Structure:**

* `tourbuddy/backend/` — Contains server code, routes, and controllers.
* `tourbuddy/frontend/` — Contains React application code, including components and pages.
* `package.json` — Root-level file to manage scripts and dependencies for the entire project.

**Typical User Flow:**

1. The user lands on the homepage and sees a list of tours.
2. Clicking on a tour shows detailed information about it.
3. The user clicks "Book Now" and fills in personal information and the desired date.
4. Upon submission, the user sees a booking confirmation message.

**Development & Deployment:**

* The app can be run with separate frontend and backend processes or using `concurrently`.
* The backend typically runs on port 8000, and the frontend on port 3001.
* API endpoints such as `/api/tours` and `/api/tours/:id` handle tour data.

**Use Case:**

This project is suitable for developers building travel booking platforms or learning full-stack web development. Its modular design allows for easy customization and future integration with databases or third-party services like payment gateways and user authentication systems.
